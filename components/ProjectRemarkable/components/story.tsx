						<h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4'>The Beginning: From Sales Coach to Life Architect</h3>
						<p>
							Once upon a time in Brisbane, I was known as &quot;The Results Guy,&quot; a title I wore with pride and a
							bit of swagger. Sales coaching wasn’t just my job; it was my identity. I helped countless businesses
							thrive, but little did everyone know, I was on a collision course with reality.

						<h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4'>The Wake-Up Call: Success at What Cost?</h3>
						<p>
							My life looked perfect on paper: a successful brand, recognition, and the adrenaline rush of sealing deal
							after deal. But beneath the surface, I was running on empty. The grind became my life, not just a part of
							it. A toxic relationship drained me, even as I poured into others.

						<h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4'>The Breakdown and Breakthrough</h3>
						<p>
							Then came the crash—my business, my body, my mind—all suffered. After losing my family and hitting rock
							bottom, I began a journey of self-discovery. Attending Tony Robbins’ UPW event with Emily was the catalyst
							for a complete transformation. It wasn’t just about healing; it was about becoming a new me.

						<h3 className='text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4'>The Rebirth: Shedding Weight, Gaining Perspective</h3>
						<p>
							I shed 30kg of physical and emotional weight, finding solace in rock climbing and adventure. These
							activities weren’t just hobbies; they were lifelines, teaching me to strategize and overcome challenges.

							The Adventure Begins: Discovering Purpose Among Peaks
						</h3>
						<p>
							In New Zealand, staring at the majestic Remarkables, Project Remarkable was born. What began as a personal
							challenge transformed into a mission: to show that ordinary people can do remarkable things with
							remarkable commitment.

							Project Remarkable: From Personal Quest to Professional Mission

						<p>
							The MAP (Mind, Body, Profit) methodology encapsulates everything I’ve learned: true success is a balance
							of mental clarity, physical health, and business acumen. Today, Project Remarkable is my legacy and a
							testament to what’s possible when you embrace the journey.
